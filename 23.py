hlf r sets register r to half its current value, then continues with the next instruction.
tpl r sets register r to triple its current value, then continues with the next instruction.
inc r increments register r, adding 1 to it, then continues with the next instruction.
jmp offset is a jump; it continues with the instruction offset away relative to itself.
jie r, offset is like jmp, but only jumps if register r is even ("jump if even").
jio r, offset is like jmp, but only jumps if register r is 1 ("jump if one", not odd).
